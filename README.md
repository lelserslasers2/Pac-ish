# pacish
 Pacman but with no walls, and 1 big coin that moves.
 
 Use arrow keys, 'wasd', or 'hjkl' to move the pacman (green square).
 
 Collecting the coin (big gold square) gives you 100 points. The goal is to get as many points as you can.
 
 Avoid the bad guys (red squares), the will try and stop you from getting the coin.
 
 After pressing 'Enter' the game will give you 3 seconds to see the starting layout. You can enter your starting direction in that time.
 
 After dying, you have 3 seconds to see how you died before going back to start screen.
